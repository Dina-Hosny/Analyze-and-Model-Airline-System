# Analyze-and-Model-Airline-System

The project’s purpose is to analyze the flight activities of some airline companies and their frequent flyers and model its data warehouse schema to store historical data, and answer some business questions.

## Project Discription:

A major airline company decided to hire you in order to assist the executive management to analyze their current business processes and expand the company by discovering new opportunities.

Executives decided that the first deliverable should focus on the flight activity in order to ensure good ongoing business process.
The marketing department wants to analyze what flights the company’s frequent flyers take, what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade, how they earn and redeem their frequent flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions, how long their overnight stays are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum or titanium status.

Your analysis shall also include the reservation process where finance team will be interested in analyzing the company profit. Note that reservation processes can take place through multiple channels.

Airline company also provides customer care interaction before, within and after your trip in order to handle customer inquiries, complaints and keep their feedback for business enhancements.

Analysis should include interaction type and problem severity (if issue exists)

State the processes for your company then apply your modeling technique/s with demonstrative layering methodology to design the logical and physical design to support such kind of analysis for decision support.
